from salaries
where salary in (
	select salary
	from salaries
	where salary > (select max(salary) - stddev(salary)
					from salaries
					where to_date > curdate()
					)
)
and to_date > curdate(); #SUPER UGLY but there are 83 current salaries within 1 STDDEV of current highest salary

select count(salary)
from salaries
where to_date > curdate(); #240124 current salaries total so 0.035% of total salaries
